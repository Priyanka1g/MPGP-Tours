# MPGP-tours
This project is all about tours and tourism. Currently we have implemented of India only. We have also implemented Savo labs API integration for authentication.
The regions of india are divided as Northern India, Eastern India, Western India, Southern India, Central India in which we have added the districts, best time to visit that place and the famous tourist places. This whole project is made from HTML, CSS and Java Script.
We have added a chat bot too from chatbot.com that works according to the conditions given by us.
We have used images from unsplash.com.
We have also used bootstrap libraries. 
Our idea is to show all the details of india regarding tourism at one place so that it would be easy for everyone to search all the beautiful places to visit at lowest time.
